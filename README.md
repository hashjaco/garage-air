#Garage Air

####What is this?

Well, this is a simple web application that utilizes the Yelp Fusion API to retrieve parking garages in an area that the user submits a search for.

####Why would I want to do that?

Ever driven in a big city? A lot of garages are just terrible, and we want you to choose the right garage. Leave the terrible parking garages to us, because it's our job to provide them with innovative technology so that they will not be so terrible while helping them optimize their profits. It's a win-win for everyone!
####Ok, so how do I run it?

Simple as pie...is that a saying?<br>
After cloning this project, run the command below within the root directory. Yes, this will spin up the API and client application.<br>
<br>```yarn parallel```<br>

Ctrl-C to kill both processes.

Thank you for trying out Garage Air! Take care!
